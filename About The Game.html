<b style="font-size:30px; color:red;">My project is a game that will determine the power of the computer on which it is run,
  and adapt certain settings according to the power and capabilities.
  Also, this game will determine which games it is suitable for and which it is not.
  I think this game is necessary for many game lovers, as well as video creators, people who deal with computers or their parts."</b>

<b style="font-size:30px; color:black;">This game will make people's lives easier because people will not have to download and register games,
  check if their computer is powerful enough for them.
  With a few clicks, the game will show whether the computer is powerful enough or not, which I think will save people time and nerves. </b>
